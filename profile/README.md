## Overview  

**AppDelete for macOS** is a lightweight yet powerful application removal tool designed to completely uninstall apps and all their associated files from your Mac. Unlike traditional deletion methods that leave behind hidden files and system junk, AppDelete ensures your system stays clean and optimized.  

When you drag an app into **AppDelete**, it automatically locates and removes related files such as preferences, caches, logs, and hidden library components. This guarantees a full cleanup and helps reclaim valuable disk space.  

The app is ideal for users looking to manage their storage efficiently, prevent system slowdowns, and maintain a tidy macOS environment. It features a sleek and intuitive interface that makes uninstalling applications effortless — perfect for both casual users and professionals who need reliable system maintenance.  

AppDelete also offers a **smart archive** feature, allowing you to store uninstalled apps temporarily for restoration if needed. It’s compatible with the latest macOS versions, including Apple Silicon (M1/M2) support, ensuring smooth performance across modern Mac devices.
